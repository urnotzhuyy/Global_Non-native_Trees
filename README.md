Global drivers of non-native tree introductions

Trees are introduced outside their native ranges, including globally threatened species, where they can pose conservation risks or benefits. A key question is understanding the global extent and drivers of non-native tree introductions. Using over 30-million occurrence records of 51,218 tree species, we find that 26,496 (51.7%) were introduced as non-natives and 155 (60.8%) families harbor threatened non-native species, with introductions across all and globally threatened species phylogenetically conserved. South America, North America, then Temperate Asia had the highest richness of non-natives, while Europe had the highest proportion (88.9% of total richness), with intra-continental movement dominating introductions. Taller species, those with lower seed mass, and non-threatened species with higher specific leaf area are more frequently introduced, with increasing non-native presence associated with warmer, wetter climates and higher social development. The prevalence of early successional and competitive traits underscores the risk of biotic homogenization, urging policies that prioritize native biodiversity.
